#STEME

**“The shortest distance between your statement and tag is STEME.”**

## Semantic Tagging Embedding Model Engine

STEME is a lightweight, deterministic module for **semantic tag assignment** using embedding vector similarity.  
It works by locating where your statement lives in vector space—and identifying which tag it’s closest to.

Unlike large language models (LLMs), STEME does **not** rely on context windows, prompt templates, or grammatical parsing.  
It’s small, fast, and powerful: a true utility layer for meaning.

---

## Why STEME?

STEME was built on a simple idea:

> **Every expression, when embedded, carries a semantic direction.**  
> **STEME tells you where it points.**

It takes:
- An embedded input (a sentence, statement, or conceptual cluster)
- A tag pool (words, phrases, categories, emotional tones, ideologies, etc.)

It returns:
- The most semantically aligned tag(s), using cosine similarity.

That’s it. No language model, no hidden weights—just location-based labeling.

---

## What Makes It Special?

STEME is not a model. It’s a **projection engine**.

It can work with:
- Individual sentences
- Averaged embeddings from memory clusters
- Translated expressions
- Visual captions (as long as embedding is compatible)
- Any vector-based representation of meaning

It can map them to:
- Emotional categories
- Political or philosophical positions
- Cognitive biases
- Cultural values
- Affective tones
- Abstract principles like “freedom,” “order,” “faith,” or “submission”

---

## Use Cases

- **Civilizism Simulation Engine**: Assigning emotional/belief tags to clusters of agent memory in social sandbox simulations
- **Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis Testing**: Comparing semantic drift across languages or vocabulary limitations
- **Education**: Tagging tone and cognitive bias in student writing across different levels
- **Social Sentiment Drift**: Monitoring belief evolution over time in social media or corpora

## Example (Coming Soon)

You’ll be able to do something like:

```python
from steme_core import get_closest_tag

embedding = get_embedding("Freedom requires responsibility.")
tag_pool = ["freedom", "chaos", "equality", "discipline", "hope"]
result = get_closest_tag(embedding, tag_pool)

print(result)
# -> 'freedom' (cosine: 0.92)
```

Future Plans
	•	Release minimal Python module (steme_core.py)
	•	Provide OpenAI + SBERT embedding compatibility
	•	Add vector cluster support
	•	Enable real-time belief/emotion monitoring for agent networks
	•	Draft research paper for Sapir-Whorf analysis using STEME
	•	Package as lightweight plugin for AI reflection frameworks
